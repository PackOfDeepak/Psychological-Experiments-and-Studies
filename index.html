    <center><p style = "font-family: cursive;font-size: 20px; margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;margin-top: 70px;">Excluding other human minds your mind is the most complex thing in the universe we know about. Our minds may not even be complex enough to understand themselves, but obviously that doesn't stop us from trying. So I created this website as a list of psychological experiments and more info on psychology. The word psychology comes from the latin word for study of the soul, now it has evolved over the years to mean the science of behavior and mental processes.</p><p style = "font-family: cursive;font-size: 20px; margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;margin-top: 70px;"> The term psychology was coined around the 16th century, and the real science wasnt formed until the late 1800's. But trying to understand ourselves goes way back to Aristotle, who tryed to find the root of human consciousness found that it was in the heart not the head, how brain might have been big, but it was no match for his heart. About 2,000 years ago in China they conducted the first psychological exams on officials. They told them to take personality and intelligence tests. In the late 800's Persian doctor Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Rhazes, also known as Rhazes, was one of the first to describe mental illness. He even treadted patients in what was basically an early psych ward in his Baghdad hospital.</p><p style = "font-family: cursive;font-size: 20px; margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;margin-top: 70px;margin-bottom: 150px;">All of this is to say is that throughout human history we have tried to understand our minds, and ask important questions like: How can humans commit terrible things like genocide and torture? Do we have free will? What is mental illness, and how can we stop it? and What is consciousness, or the notion of the self? Non rhetorical question, because I DONT KNOW!!! Nobody does, and thats why these experiments try to answer them. So lets get started</p></center>
