    <h3 style = "font-family: cursive;background-color: gold;"><center>Ivan Palvov's Classical Conditioning Experiments(1901)</center></h3>
    <center><p style = "font-family: cursive;font-size: 17px; margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;margin-top: 40px;">Pavlov, who studied the digestive tracts of dogs (work that won him the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine), noticed that his canine subjects began to salivate as soon as they saw the lab assistant who normally fed them, which he called “psychic secretion.” Pavlov designed an experiment in which dogs heard the sound of a metronome(that piano thing that keeps you on beat), and are then given food. The dogs began to salivate at the sound of the metronome. This shows that nerological connections can be built and torn apart. Later studies show the same for humans</p></center>
    <h3 style = "font-family: cursive;background-color: blue;color:gold"><center>The Little Albert Experiment(1920)</center></h3>
    
    <center><p style = "font-family: cursive;font-size: 17px; margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;margin-top: 40px;">This experiment was carried out by John Watson, with assistance from Rosalie Rayner, to test if it was possible to intentionally condition fear in an otherwise normal child. Watson exposed an baby/toddler(known as albert, cuz that was the best name in the 1920's) to a multiple fluffy stimuli like a rat, a rabbit, and wool. The infant showed no fear.  Watson then began to expose the infant to a white rat, while banging a bar with a hammer to create a loud, scary noise whenever the infant interacted with the rat. Eventually, Albert began to react with distress when exposed to any white fluffy stimuli, including a Santa Claus mask. As you would guess(or hope) the experiment was criticized on many levels.The experiment has been heavily criticized on both ethical grounds (for the infliction of trauma on an infant) and on procedural grounds (as one child identified as potentially being “Little Albert” may have been born with serious cognitive impairment). As previously mentioned, you can do anything, in the name of science.</p></center>

    <center><p style = "font-family: cursive;font-size: 17px; margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;margin-top: 40px;"> This was developed by psychologist B. F. Skinner during his time as a graduate student at Harvard</p></center>
